There are two Azure roles you can apply to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user or group:

Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role

Allows access to Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterAdminCredential/action API call. This API call lists the cluster admin credentials.
Downloads kubeconfig for the clusterAdmin role.
Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role

Allows access to Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action API call. This API call lists the cluster user credentials.
Downloads kubeconfig for clusterUser role.
 
Note:

On clusters that use Azure AD, users with the clusterUser role have an empty kubeconfig file that prompts a login. Once logged in, users have access based on their Azure AD user or group settings. Users with the clusterAdmin role have admin access.

On clusters that don't use Azure AD, the clusterUser role has same effect of clusterAdmin role.
